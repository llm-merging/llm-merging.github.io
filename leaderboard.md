## Discord Leaderboard
On Discord 
* [4090 Leaderboard](https://discord.com/channels/1124130156336922665/1151568318013132831)
* [A100 Leaderboard](https://discord.com/channels/1124130156336922665/1151568359251509319)

## How to use the leaderboard
The [Lightning AI](https://lightning.ai/) ‚ö° team has built us a leaderboard on Discord. This is the single best way you can make sure your submissions actually work before the submission, try to beat the unfinetuned toy submission as a starting point.

You might have noticed a new friendly bot has joined the server called @evalbot  to use it
1. DM the bot with `eval 4090` or `eval A100` and attach a zipped file of your submission to the message (You can also just openly message the bot but DM'ing will protect your secret sauce)
2. If successful the bot will give you a job ID and a running status, the eval will take roughly 1-2h so be patient if you're top of queue
3. Once the bot completes your run it will update either the ‚Å†leaderboard_4090  or ‚Å†leaderboard_a100 channel, we will not be monitoring these 2 text channels they will be purely for the bot to post the new updated leaderboard
